Description: CyberGIS-Jupyter to submit to XSEDE Comet
        =======================
        
        This library is a production configuration for submitting HPC jobs from Jupyter notebooks. Here the [SUMMA](https://ncar.github.io/hydrology/models/SUMMA) model is used as the example Hydro model to be run on HPC; and the target HPC platform is [Comet](https://portal.xsede.org/sdsc-comet), which is one of the super-computeris that [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) is managing.
        
        The principle here is to use [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to pull the [SUMMA Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bartnijssen/summa/tags/); and copy the SUMMA test data to Comet; and then construct and submit a HPC job script based on a existing template and user's inputs in the GUI widgest; Finally the status of the job is dynamically updated in the widgets, and the output graph is downloaded back and displayed in the notebook.
        
        ## Prepare
        
        The folder `summatest/` contains the customized test data of SUMMA. The singularity image is not included in the repo due to its size. So to prepare the library, it is required to build the SUMMA singularity image from Dokcer hub using `singularity pull docker://bartnijssen/summa summa.img` in the `summatest/` folder.
        
        Besides, an account on Comet with corresponding allocation is needed to sign-in and complete the computation.
        
        ## Install
        
        Run `python3 setup.py install` to install the `cyebrgis` python library.
        
        ## Usage
        
        A basic example usage of this library is shown below:
